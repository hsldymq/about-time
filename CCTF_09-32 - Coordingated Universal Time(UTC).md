### 1.1. 1960年之前的历史 (History before 1960)

在19世纪, 世界时(universal time)一词通常是指这样一种时间,在世界任何一个地方读到它都是一致的,并且将它用作"通用"时间. 与时间标准相反,一种普遍作法是将许多"本地"时间都以其所在的当地子午线为准. 这类作法并不一定得跟某种时标联系起来,例如格林尼治平均时间(GMT). 尽管时间这个主题最初并未涵盖在1875年5月20日所签署的"米公约"中 ([Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, 2006](#TODO)), 但从那以后它就成为该公约中的重要组成部分.
> In the 19<sup>th</sup> century the words "universal time" were used typically to refer to the concept of time that would read the same everywhere in the world and be used as a conventional, or "universal," time standard as opposed to common practice in which many "local" times referred to many local meridians. The phrase did not necessarily refer to a particular time scale such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Although the subject of time was not covered originally in the Treaty of the Meter that was signed on May 20, 1875, (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, 2006) it has since become part of the mission of the organizational structure put in place by the Treaty.
