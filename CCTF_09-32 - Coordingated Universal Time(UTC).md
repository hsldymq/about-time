### 1.1. 1960年之前的历史 (History before 1960)


> In the 19<sup>th</sup> century the words "universal time" were used typically to refer to the concept of time that would read the same everywhere in the world and be used as a conventional, or "universal," time standard as opposed to common practice in which many "local" times referred to many local meridians. The phrase did not necessarily refer to a particular time scale such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Although the subject of time was not covered originally in the Treaty of the Meter that was signed on May 20, 1875, (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, 2006) it has since become part of the mission of the organizational structure put in place by the Treaty.
